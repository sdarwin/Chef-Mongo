Note: this was a github fork from 2012, adding features to the Mongo cookbook.  
It's no longer maintained, check with Chef Supermarket for the latest Mongo.

See README.md.orig

This is a Chef recipe to install MongoDB based on edelight.  

The original recipe has a restriction that the shard server, config server, and mongos server be on different machines.  That is actually quite a problem in many cases.   It is fixed here.  The change was of moderate complexity, neither trivial nor super difficult.

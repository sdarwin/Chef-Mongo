This is a Chef recipe to install MongoDB based on edelight.  

The original recipe has a restriction that the shard server, config server, and mongos server be on different machines.  That is actually quite a problem in many cases.   It is fixed here.  The change was of moderate complexity, neither trivial nor super difficult.
